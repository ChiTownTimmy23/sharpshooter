**Conventions**
- Lower_snake_case for files/dirs (e.g., `routers/user_routes.py`).
- Prefer named exports for routers/utilities.
- Keep simple conditionals one-line (`if cond: do()`); avoid unnecessary braces.
- Keep examples concise and technical.
- Track API metrics (latency, throughput); surface them in logs/telemetry.
